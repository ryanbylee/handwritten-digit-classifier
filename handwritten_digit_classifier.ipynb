        "### Final Project Skeleton Code\n",
        "This notebook is meant to be skeleton code for the final project. We have filled in the code to allow you to download the dataset and train your neural network on it. We have not made the neural network for you. All of the specifics, including layer sizes and hyperparameters, are up to you to decide. Some of this code may not work perfectly for you, so you will have to read it and understand what is going on so that you can create your neural network. The testing cell at the end is how we will be testing your neural networks, so be sure that whatever you do, it works with that cell. (For example: do any data processing such as flattening and padding in the forward function rather than in the testing loop as we will not be editing our testing loop to reflect any of those changes)"
